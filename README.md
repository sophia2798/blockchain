# Blockchain

## Overview
A basic blockchain built in Python. Utilizes Python hash module to create hashes for each block and Python Flask Framework to make HTTP requests to the blockchain. The tutorial followed can be found [here](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46).

## Use
I used PyCharm to create this blockchain although any Python IDE will suffice. If your IDE allows direct GitHub repository cloning from its GUI, use that. Otherwise, copy either the HTTP or SSH link from the repository home page and clone it locally using:

    git clone insert_copy_link_here

Then, open the cloned file using any IDE you prefer.

I am still relatively new to the world of Python. So, if you have any questions, comments, or would like to collaborate please do not hesistate to reach out via my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/sophia2798) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophia2798/)!
